# currencyConverter
 
A simple currency conversion program built in Python.

The intention of this project was to practice getting data from an API, and to experience building a UI in Python.

The API for currency data is [freecurrencyapi.com](https://freecurrencyapi.com/)

Libraries used:
- Tkinter - for UI building tools
- Requests - for API request handling
- JSON - for JSON handling

Todo:
- Fix changing value and making another request
